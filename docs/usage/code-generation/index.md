# Noble Copypasta

Unit tests are the most tragic victim of haphazard copypasta.

*And* they are a totally understandable thing to copy-paste.

But it's fine until its not. Docstrings go stale, filenames make no sense, random unrelated state gets set up during tests, suites are repeated. Sadness ensues.

## `pytest` Commands

Well, flags I guess.

## Comments via `anno`

We love em!
